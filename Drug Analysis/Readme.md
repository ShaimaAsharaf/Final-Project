## Build a model to predict the outcome of the drugs that might be suitable for the patient.
# Overview
### Prediction models help healthcare professionals and patients make clinical decisions. The goal of an accurate prediction model is to provide patient risk stratification to support clinical decision-making with the hope of improving patient outcomes and quality of care.
# Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/code/asthamular/drug-200-patients/data
# Dataset details
### This data set contains Age,Gender,Cholestrol level,Bp level ,Drug taken,Na_to_K ratio as  cloumns(features) with 200 entries.
# Problem Statement
### Using the drug dataset to build a model that predict the outcome of the drugs that might be accurate for the patient.
# Implementation:
### Libraries: NumPy, pandas, sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
# Approach
### The aim is to create a model that helps the users to apply machine learning approach to predict the outcome of the drugs that might be accurate for the patients. Here, the models used are:

### xgBoost Classifier
### KNN
### Decision Tree Classifier
### Random Forest Classifier
# Conclusion
### Random forest, decision tree and xgboost are  best among  the models with an accuracy score of 1.0
